# babyTorch
Implementation and training of various deep learning architectures from scratch, for learning purposes.

Currently implemented:
  - Linear layer, Convolutional layer (2d), Dropout layer (1d), Max pool layer (2d)
  - Adam optimizer
  - Examples where we build and train deep learning models using these models.

To implement:
  - LSTM
  - Transformer
  - RNN?
